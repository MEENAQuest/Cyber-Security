Ethical Practices While Using Internet

Do's

1 Keeping Your Privacy -
Always make use of your own computer to log in into your accounts. Making use of public computers and cyber cafes for personal work can be risky because we don't know about the security levels of these computers.

2 Browsing Safe Links - 
Use known websites only. Clicking on unknown links can invite viruses into the system. Stay away from any ads or external links on any website that you visit.

3 Secured Passwords - 
Use Healthy Passwords. Healthy passwords consists of atleast 8-10 letters and should be a combination of letters, numbers and special characters.

4 Secured Connections - 
Always protect your network with strong passwords. Use your home Wi-Fi or mobile data to access the internet. Stay away from public Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi hotspots.


Dont's

1 Online Bullying - 
Never be mean to someone on the internet. Whether it is a stranger or a person you know. Always respect each other's boundaries. If you are victim of online bullying simply report to your parents and teachers and take proper guidance.

2 Interacting with Strangers - 
Do not add any stranger as a friend in your profile. Always add those whom you are already familiar with.

3 Sharing Information - 
Do not share your personal information with anyone on the internet. Do not share details like your name, surname, number, home address, school address, any banking or government files. All these are classified information and should be kept private.

Do not create fake profiles. When online do not pretend to be someone else and do anything under their name.
